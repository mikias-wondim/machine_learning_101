Most of the codes are from the Udemy course titled ["Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R"](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) created by [Kirill Eremenko](https://github.com/kirilleremenko) and [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://github.com/hadelin2p). This project is intended to be used as a template for machine learning models. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

Your ML Buddy,
